    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      John R. Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 â€“ September 12, 2003) was
      an American singer songwriter. Much of Cash's music contained themes of
      sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages
      of his career.[4][5] He was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice,
      the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by
      train-like chugging guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness[7][8] coupled with an
      increasingly somber and humble demeanor,free prison concerts,and a
      trademark all-black stage wardrobe which earned him the nickname "The Man
      in Black".
